# freezer-manager-desktop
The purpose of this application is to assist my wife with her crocheting projects. Designing a certain type of blanket ("granny-square" blankets) takes a fair amount of time and graph paper, so I threw this together a while ago to help her. I got distracted before finishing this due to starting on the freezer inventory project, but she is starting a new blanket soon and I would like to get it in a better state.
